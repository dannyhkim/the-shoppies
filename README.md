# The Shoppies
Managing movie nominations for The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs. 


[Deployed Version](https://the-shoppies-movie-nominations.herokuapp.com/)

## The Challenge 
We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.


## Technical Requirements
1. Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
2. Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
3. Updates to the search terms should update the result list
4. Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
5. If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
6. Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.

## Extras
For my Shoppies movie nomination website, I decided to include extra features including saving the nomination list in the case that the user leaves the page, creating a polished design with CSS, [MDBootstrap for React](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/b5/react/), and adding animations for loading, adding/deleting movies and nominations with [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/).
